# Logs PowerShell Script

This PowerShell script is designed to help analyze Windows event logs by detecting errors, warnings, and other log entries. It provides flexibility to filter logs by severity, date range, and log type, and outputs the results in a variety of formats.

## üöÄ Features:
- Retrieves **Error**, **Warning**, and other log entries (e.g., Application, System, Security) from Windows Event Logs.
- Allows filtering logs by **severity** and **date range**.
- Outputs results to **.txt**, **CSV** files, and can even send logs via **email**.
- Supports an **interactive mode** for easier use and custom configurations.
- Option to automate script execution with **Task Scheduler**.

## üìå Usage

### Navigate to the script directory:
```sh
cd PowerShell-Log-Analyzer
```

### Open PowerShell as Administrator (required to access event logs):
1. Press **Win + X** and select **PowerShell (Admin)**.
2. Navigate to the script‚Äôs directory by running:
   ```sh
   cd C:\path\to\PowerShell-Log-Analyzer
   ```

### Run the script with the desired parameters:
The script allows you to specify how many days of logs to check, which log type to analyze, and where to save the results. Example:
```sh
.\logs.ps1 -days 7 -logName "System" -outputFormat "txt" -email "example@example.com"
```
This will retrieve logs from the **System** event log for the last **7 days** and save them as a **.txt** file.

- If an **email** is provided, the script will send the logs to the specified email address.

### View the results:
- By default, the output file is saved in **C:\temp\Event_Logs.txt**.
- If you selected **CSV** format, the file will be named **Event_Logs.csv**.
- Open the file using **Notepad, Excel, or any text editor**.
